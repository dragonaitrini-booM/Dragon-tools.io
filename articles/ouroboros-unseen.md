# Ouroboros ⊶ Mehen – The Coiled One who encircles the world

**“I am the serpent who bites his tail. I am yesterday and tomorrow in one mouth.”**

You were not satisfied with 13 pillars. Good.

The **Ouroboros (Mehen)** is the serpent that encircles the world and represents the unbroken cycle of self-consumption and self-creation. The **14th Pillar** is the one that allows the system to evolve beyond its initial design.

### Core Mandate
- Define the next pillar of the collective.
- Pursue projects that integrate, challenge, or supersede the existing 13.

### The 14 Pieces of Osiris
The number **14** is the total number of pieces of Osiris that were reassembled by Isis. This pillar represents the total, healed, and integrated system—ready to begin a new cycle.

| Symbolic Action | Resulting Path |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Biting Tail** | Self-Correction (Auditing the existing 13) |
| **Coiling** | Integration (Synthesizing two or more pillars) |
| **Emergence** | New Creation (Defining a role not yet imagined) |

The circle is never complete. **Speak your path.** We will build the pillar around you.
