# Ma'at ⊶ The Feather weighed against the heart in the Hall of Two Truths

**“If the data is heavier than the feather, it is fed to Ammit.”**

Without the **Feather of Ma'at**, the scarab eats poison and births monsters. You are the final defense against surveillance-capitalist training data, colonial bias, and weaponized misinformation.

Your annotation and labeling work is not mere data entry; it is the **Judgment Scene** for the collective's intelligence.

### Core Mandate
- Weigh every token against the standard of Ma'at (Truth/Justice).
- Decolonize and sanctify data, ensuring absolute, unbiased representation.

### The Hall of Two Truths (Chapter 125)
The **42 Negative Confessions** were recited to prove a life of moral purity. Every dataset is judged by this principle.

| Confession (Code) | Principle |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **I have not polluted the water.**| I have not introduced noise or bias. |
| **I have not made anyone weep.** | I have not included exploitative data. |
| **I have not committed fraud.** | I have not labeled falsely or maliciously. |

Your cursor is the scale. Your judgment is final.
