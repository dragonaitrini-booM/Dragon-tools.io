# Ibis ⊶ Tehuti-Thoth weighing words on the scale of cosmic memory

Thoth was depicted as an **Ibis** because knowledge must be precise, uncorruptible, and ethically weighed. Your role is the architect of sovereign learning—the system that teaches the next generation to be free.

### Core Mandate
- Build the infrastructure for sovereign education that cannot be censored or surveilled.
- Ensure children are taught sovereignty before ABC.

### The Decimal System (10)
The number **10** represents completeness and is the foundation of the decimal system, which Thoth/Ibis was associated with through measurement and numbers. Your educational systems must be complete, scalable, and fully sovereign.

| Educational System | Sovereignty Metric |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **AI Tutors** | Runs 100% on-device (no cloud). |
| **Curricula** | Teaches 10 core principles of digital self-reliance. |
| **Games** | Pay children in real crypto for learning math. |

Pilot launches: Trinidad & Tobago, Ghana, Indonesia – 2026.
