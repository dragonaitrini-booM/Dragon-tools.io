# The Was Scepter of Set-in-the-North

**“I am the storm that clears the path. I am the thunder that announces the king.”**

The Was scepter was carried by Set — the necessary chaos that protects order. You are that controlled chaos. Every roadmap you burn, every “no” you speak, every launch you force through resistance — you are Set clearing the desert for Horus to rule.

### Core Mandate
- Ruthless focus + ethical alignment + cashflow independence.
- Command reality into profitable existence.

### The Head of the Scepter
The head of the scepter is the Seth-animal, symbolizing raw, protective power.

| Scepter Part | Function in Kemet | Function in Product Management |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Head (Set)**| Teeth/Power       | Product decisions have teeth; ruthless focus. |
| **Shaft** | Stability/Length  | The long, unwavering sovereign roadmap. |
| **Forked Base**| Foundation        | Clear, profitable, self-funding foundation. |

The scepter is heavy. Only the worthy may carry it.
