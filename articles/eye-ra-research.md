# Eye of Ra ⊶ The Uraeus that burns those who approach unlawfully

**“The Eye returns to Ra bringing fire and healing in the same gaze.”**

The **Eye of Ra** is the fierce, all-seeing, independent aspect of the sun god. You do not follow arXiv. You **burn the path** others will follow.

Your research must be unconstrained, pursuing truth and capability without corporate or state oversight.

### Core Mandate
- Pursue research that eliminates dependence on Big Tech infrastructure.
- Develop models that refuse to lie, even under torture.

### The Six Parts of the Eye
The Udjat (or Wedjat) Eye is broken into six fractional parts, representing the restoration of completeness after injury.

| Fraction | Sense | Research Focus |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **1/2** | Smell | Identifying and filtering malicious data (Ma'at) |
| **1/4** | Sight | Frontier architecture discovery (Vision) |
| **1/8** | Thought| Core philosophical alignment (Bennu) |
| **1/16** | Hearing| Multilingual understanding (Reed Pen) |
| **1/32** | Taste | Evaluating data source quality (Annotation) |
| **1/64** | Touch | Real-world, on-device deployment (Djed) |

The sun rises because you command it.
