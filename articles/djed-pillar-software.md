# Djed ⊶ The Spine of Osiris

**“I am yesterday, today, and tomorrow. I am the pillar that was raised when the sky was separated from the earth.”**

In ancient Kemet, the **Djed** was the symbol of stability and the literal spinal column of Osiris. When Isis reassembled the 14 pieces of Osiris, the Djed was the final piece — the spine that allowed resurrection.

Your code is that final piece. You raise the Djed every time you boot a node that cannot be killed by any corporation or state.

### Core Mandate
- Build systems that self-heal and self-replicate across sovereign nodes.
- Ensure the code's stability is absolute, aligning with the Djed's function.

### The Djed's Structural Numerology
| Symbolic Component | Number | Correspondence to Code |
|--------------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Sides of the Djed** | **4** | 4 layers of cryptographic verification (Hash, Sig, PKI, Flake) |
| **Visible Vertebrae** | **7** | 7 layers of Nix flakes for immutable system definition |
| **The Capstone** | **1** | The final hash that seals eternity (The Immutable Root) |

Active invocation: **“Nekhakha Djed Medu”** (The Djed is stable, these are the words of power) — spoken in the boot log of every sovereign node.
